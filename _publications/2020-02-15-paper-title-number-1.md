excerpt: 'Neural networks are considered to be approximate functions, but what if we considered them as a memory with a capacity?  CacheNet  is  a  neural  network  that  dissects  other  neural  networks’  memories  and  caches  only  the  parts  of memories  needed  on  an  edge  device, significantly shortening inference time on an edge device.'

Neural networks are considered to be approximate functions, but what if we considered them as a memory with a capacity?  CacheNet  is  a  neural  network  that  dissects  other  neural  networks’  memories  and  caches  only  the  parts  of memories  needed  on  an  edge  device, significantly shortening inference time on an edge device.
