Educating the scientists of the future, me and my team designed an 8 week long program as part of a summer camp to teach youth (ages 10-12) important Data Science skills and concepts. The tutorials were made in Jupyter Notebooks, and students would interact through them with concepts like: curating a Super Hero data set, data cleaning with "Pandas" library, analysis and plotting distributions using "matplotlib" and how they could visualise data to make sense of the underlying story it tells. The concepts were adapted for the audience to ensure maximum participation.
