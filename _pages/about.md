* Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm currently a graduate student in McMaster University's [Data Science Lab](http://db.cas.mcmaster.ca) working on my Master's degree. 

* My research interests are Deep Learning inference on low-resource devices, image processing and using natural language processing for time-series analysis.
