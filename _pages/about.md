* Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm currently a Data Scientist at [GoldSpot Discoveries Corp](http://https://goldspot.ca/), working on cool computer vision and model production problems.

* I was previously a graduate Master's student in McMaster University's [Data Science Lab](http://db.cas.mcmaster.ca) during which I also did an internship at [Ensho Health](https://www.enshohealth.com/). Previous to that, I attained my undergraduate degree at [Sharif University of Technology](http://ce.sharif.edu) in the field of Computer Engineering.

* My research interests are computer vision, model compression, uncertainty in deep learning and model robustness.
