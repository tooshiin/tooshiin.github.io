* Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm currently a graduate student in McMaster University's [Data Science Lab](http://db.cas.mcmaster.ca) working on my Master's degree. I previously attained my undergraduate degree at [Sharif University of Technology](http://ce.sharif.edu) in the field of Computer Engineering.

* My research interests are Deep inference, accelerating neural networks and computational efficiency. I'm also interested in the intersection of AI and healthcare technologies.
